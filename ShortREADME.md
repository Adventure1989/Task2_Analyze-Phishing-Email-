###  2. Examine sender's email address for spoofing.

*Red Flag: Sender's email address is : services@paypal-accounts.com* <br>
**Domain Spoofing detected: Use of "paypal-accounts.com" instead of "@paypal.com"**

###  4. Identify suspicious links or attachments.

**"Confirm Your Information" button most likely redirects to fake PayPal login page designed to steal credentials** <br>

Additionally, there is no visible url shown in the email - seems to be suspicious 

### 5. Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.

*Multiple tactics - threatening have been identified* <br>
$Example$ <br>
*"Your account access has been limited"* <br>
*"You have 24 hours to solve the problem"* 

**This highlights false urgency**

### 6. Note any mismatched URLs

*a) The email cannot verify the actual destination  without hovering  <br>
b) The sender domain already shows mismatch as specified previously   <br>
c) The confirm Button likely leads to a fraudulent domain falsifying domain address* 

### 7. Verify presence of speling or grammar errors.

*a) "We are sorry to inform you that you no longer have access" -  phrasing suspicious  <br>
b) Missing punctuation: "Your PayPal account is limited, You have 24 hours" should be "limited. You have"  <br>
c) "We believe that your account is in danger from unauthorized users" - weird usage of words coming from Paypal template* 


###  8. Summarize phishing traits found in the email

*High Risk Indicators:* <br>

1. Spoofed domain: paypal-accounts.com <br>
2. Account threat: Claims account limitation and permanent disability <br>
3. Time pressure: 24-hour deadline  creates fake urgency  <br>
4. Data harvesting: Request for "confirm account details" - redirecting to fake domain <br>
5. Suspicious button: Unclear destination link <br>
6. Poor professional language used: Multiple language issues <br>
7. Generic greeting: "Dear PayPal customer" instead of actual name
